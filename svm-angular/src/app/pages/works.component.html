        <h1>web projects</h1>
        <p>
            Here are some of the web projects I have worked on. My professional works have a <span class="mdi mdi-professional-hexagon" style="font-size:20px;"></span> mark on the title. My personal projects, including this page, are self-hosted on my small web server (so please, do not DDoS me).
        </p>
        <p>I also make non-web Windows apps (WPF). These are small personal tools like batch file renamer, notes, power control, and backup apps. I even converted one of them to a web app (Search-Prime). The projects below are only web apps.</p>
